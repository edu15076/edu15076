# Hello, I am Eduardo

## Of the capabilities

### OOP
I am very familiar with design properties, principles and patterns, I am always trying to implement code in order to follow the principles, using some patterns throughout my code. These are the most important matter to help create better code for others to read, understand, use and increment.

I also work with OO languages and I can conceptualize inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces, abstraction, composition and aggregation very well, understanding the nuances of each. With OO languages I also comprehend relaxion and am able to work with it with ease.

### Base skills
I have also a great comprehension on classical algorithms and data structures. Being able to both implement and use them in my favor.

Mathematics is also a field that I am very found of and very capable too, it very often helps me create better code.

Of the hardware, I have studied digital systems and computer organization, letting me produce some circuits at breadboards and understand the functioning of a computer. In that field, I am also able to code in assembly and C for microcontrollers.

I also know how to work with Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, Git, PowerShell and Bash.

### Languages and Experience
Of the languages, I am very familiar with Python, Java, C/C++, JavaScript, TypeScript and SQL. I also know a small bit of PHP. I also have a great deal of experience with HTML, CSS and XML.

At last, but not least, I am capable of extracting the requirements of a software from the client and projecting the software based on use cases, class diagrams and many others diagrams.

Most of my previous experience includes web development, I have developed many apps with Django Framework, alone and with a team, I have produced a store's SaaS system with Jakarta and JDBC and some static websites in which my Chess website shines. The rest of my experience come from solving small problems from Olympiads and Leet Code, also some small Math related code, like a mathematical vector class that I have implemented, and Classical algorithms.

## Formation ##
I am a student at CEFET-MG's technical informatics course. I am, currently, cursing my second year in this institution, out of three. I have already released a paper where I am one of the authors in a research project that I took part.
